          <p>There are many sports that I like, but basketball beats all of them. It uses alot os teamwork. I play it a lot and got really good.</p>
          <p>I play basketball with my friends at school. I aslo play it with my brothers and dad. I enjoy playing basketball everyday. My second favorite is football and it is a close second.</P>
